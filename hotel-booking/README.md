# 🏨 Hotel Booking Data Analysis & Cancellation Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive data science project that involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** to understand booking patterns and predict cancellations for a hotel dataset.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, I explored the data to answer several critical business questions:

* **Guest Origins:** Identified the countries from which the majority of guests are coming.
* **Room Pricing:** Analyzed the average daily rate (ADR) to see how much guests pay per night.
* **Price Variation:** Visualized how the price per night fluctuates over the year due to seasonality.
* **Busy Months:** Identified the most busy months for both city and resort hotels.
* **Stay Duration:** Analyzed the average length of time people stay at the hotels.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
To assist in revenue management, I built a predictive model to identify bookings that are likely to be canceled:

* **Model Objective:** Binary classification to predict if a booking will be canceled or not.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and categorical encoding.
* **Algorithm:** Used industry-standard classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression/Random Forest).
* **Evaluation:** Optimized the model based on Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
